# import Â tkinter 
from tkinter import * # Imports all widgets from the Tkinter library.
from tkinter import messagebox # Imports the messagebox module for pop-up windows.


# Create the Main App Window
age_app = Tk() # Creates the main application window.

# Change App title
age_app.title("Calculate Your Age") # Sets the title of the window.


# Set Dimensions
age_app.geometry("400x200") # Sets the width and height of the window in pixels.

# Write Age Label
the_text =Label(age_app, text="Write Your Age", height=2, font=("Arial", 20)) # Creates a text label to instruct the user.

# Place The Text Into The Main Window
the_text.pack() # Places the label widget into the window.


# Age Variables
age = StringVar() # Creates a special Tkinter variable to store the age input.

# Set Default Value For Age
age.set("00") # Sets the initial value of the age variable to "00".


# Create the input for age
age_input = Entry(age_app, width=2 , font=("Arial", 30), textvariable=age) # Creates an input field for the user to enter their age.


# Place the input into the main window
age_input.pack() # Places the input field widget into the window.


# Create the calculate function
def calc(): # Defines a function to perform the age calculation when called.
    # Get Age In Years and convert to an integer
    the_age_value = int(age.get()) # Retrieves the value from the `age` variable and converts it to an integer.
    
    # Get Time Units
    months = the_age_value * 12 # Calculates the number of months.
    weeks = months * 4 # Calculates the number of weeks.
    days = the_age_value * 365 # Calculates the number of days.
    
    # Create Text Lines
    line_one = f"Your Age In Months Is: {months}" # Formats a string to display age in months.
    line_two = f"Your Age In Weeks Is: {weeks}" # Formats a string to display age in weeks.
    line_three = f"Your Age In Days Is: {days}" # Formats a string to display age in days.
    
    # Group all lines
    all_lines = [line_one, line_two, line_three] # Combines all lines into a list.
    
    # Show The Message Box
    messagebox.showinfo("Your Age In All Time Units", "\n".join(all_lines)) # Displays a pop-up box with the calculated age details.


# Create the calculate button
button = Button(age_app, text="Calculate ", width=20, height=2, bg="#0e1063", fg="white", borderwidth=0, command=calc) # Creates a button that executes the `calc` function when clicked.
# Place button in the main window
button.pack() # Places the button widget into the window.


# Run App Infinitely
age_app.mainloop() # Starts the Tkinter event loop to run the application and wait for user interaction.
