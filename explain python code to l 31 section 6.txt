
1. `x = 5`
   - This line assigns the value 5 to the variable `x`. 
   - Example: If you think of `x` as a box, you are putting the number 5 inside that box.

2. (blank line)
   - This is just an empty line for better readability. It doesn't affect the code execution.

3. `if x > 2:`
   - This line checks if the value of `x` is greater than 2.
   - Example: Since `x` is 5, which is greater than 2, this condition is true, so the code inside this `if` block will be executed.

4. `    if x < 10:`
   - This line is indented, meaning it is inside the previous `if` block. It checks if `x` is less than 10.
   - Example: Since `x` is 5, which is less than 10, this condition is also true, so the code inside this `if` block will be executed.

5. `        if x == 5:`
   - This line is further indented, meaning it is inside the previous `if` block. It checks if `x` is equal to 5.
   - Example: Since `x` is indeed 5, this condition is true, so the code inside this `if` block will be executed.

6. `            print("x is = 5 that's true")`
   - This line is inside the previous `if` block and will be executed if all the above conditions are true. It prints the message "x is = 5 that's true" to the console.
   - Example: Since all conditions are true, the message "x is = 5 that's true" will be displayed.

In summary, this code checks if `x` is greater than 2, less than 10, and equal to 5. If all these conditions are met, it prints a message confirming that `x` is indeed 5.
